# Remembering the Kanji Flash Cards
Take word lists from RTK and export CSVs for flash card apps.

## Usage
Run `rtklists.py`. The program will prompt through what lesson the
user has completed to output a long list of all characters. The
program also makes lists for each lesson.

## Output
Two types of lists are made in a `cards` subdirectory:

1. 1st column keyword (5th ed), 2nd column kanji
2. 1st column kanji, 2nd column keyword (5th ed)

Lists have no headings and are UTF-8 encoded.

## My flashcard apps
I use [ianki] and [memrise] on iphone.

[ianki]: http://ianki.com/
[memrise]: http://www.memrise.com/home/

## Kanji List
The list of all the RTK Kanji was downloaded from http://ziggr.com/heisig/
